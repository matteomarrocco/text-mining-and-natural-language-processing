# ðŸ“š NLP Project: Text Analysis on *Murder on the Orient Express*

This project explores **textual analysis** on Agatha Christieâ€™s *Murder on the Orient Express*, applying NLP techniques to extract insights from the text.  

The analysis includes **Named Entity Recognition (NER), sentiment and emotion analysis, co-occurrence analysis, knowledge graph construction, and topic modeling**, highlighting patterns, relationships, and themes within the narrative.

## Methodology

- **Data Import & Preprocessing:** Text data was imported from the book in `.txt` format and cleaned for analysis.  
- **Feature Extraction:** Created wordclouds, TF-IDF tables, and other textual features.  
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Identified characters, places, and other entities.  
- **Sentiment & Emotion Analysis:** Explored narrative themes and emotions.  
- **Co-Occurrence & Knowledge Graphs:** Built co-occurrence matrices and graphs to map relationships between characters and key terms.  
- **Topic Modeling:** Applied **LDA, NMF, and BERTopic**, with BERTopic producing the most meaningful topics.  
- **Discussion & Conclusion:** Insights were interpreted to reflect on the complexity of literary texts, challenges encountered, and potential directions for future work.


## Key Outcomes
- Extracted meaningful character interactions and narrative patterns.  
- Revealed dominant themes and emotional tones throughout the story.  
- Constructed knowledge graphs linking entities and frequently associated terms.  
- Demonstrated the potential of NLP techniques for literary analysis.
